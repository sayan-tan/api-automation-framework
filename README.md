`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**_REPORTING_** :

1) **Python-html Report**

   Install pytest-html command line tool using:

   `pip install pytest-html`

   You are now set to run your test with pytest runner by specifying the directory path to save your HTML report, for example :
   
   `pytest --html=Report.html`
    

   You can open the report that is created in the root directory with the name "Report.html"


2) **Allure Report**

   Install the Allure command line tool using 
   
   `npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev`


   Steps on how to generate an Allure report using pytest

   -> In your project directory, you first need to generate a folder to save the allure reports, you can automatically generate this with a command:-
   
   `allure generate`
   
   This will create a folder named allure-report in your project directory.
   
   -> You are now set to run your test with pytest runner by specifying the directory path to save your allure report, for example :
   
   `pytest --alluredir=allure-report/`
   
   -> Once test execution completes, all the test results will get stored in the allure-report directory.
   
   You can now view the allure-report in the browser with the command â€“
   
   `allure serve allure-report/`
